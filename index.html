					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p>Q: Is LovelyBox a Christian company?</p>
					<h5>A: Yes! Our founders, Ruth Galdamez and Andrea Portilla, both work diligently in their churches in women's ministry. They are a mother/daughter team!</h5>
					<p>Q: What is LovelyBox and how does it work?</p>
					<h5>A: Lovely Box was inspired as both women began to see a need in the lives of their friends and coworkers. Christian women that have a full plate and at times feel alone, depressed and lost in a sea of fear. How great would it be to encourage one woman at a time with a LovelyBox filled with love?</h5>
					<p>Q: When will I receive my first box?</p>
					<h5>A: Upon your subscription we will send your box that same week. You will then receive your monthly box before the 15th of each month thereafter.</h5>
					<p>Q: When is my credit card charged?</p>
					<h5>A: Your credit card is charged on the day you sign up; and afterwards, it is re-billed on the first of the month based on your subscription length.</h5>
					<p>Q: Do you ship internationally?</p>
					<h5>A: Not at this time.</h5>
					<p>Q: What's in the box?</p>
					<h5>A: Each month's box is unique, filled with beauty samples, prayer cards, scripture cards, jewelry and various trinkets that you will love to receive.</h5>
					<p>Q: Does my subscription auto-renew?</p>
					<h5>A: Yes, subscriptions will auto-renew for the same subscription period for which you signed up. However, it's easy to cancel if you choose to cancel. Gifts do not auto-renew. </h5>
					<p>Q: Can I send a single box gift subscription?</p>
					<h5>A: Yes!</h5>
					<p>Q: How can I cancel or manage my account?</p>
					<h5>A: Send an email to lovelybox@gmail.com</h5>
