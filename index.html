				<h>Frequently Asked Questions</h>
				<p>Q: Is LovelyBox a Christian company?</p>
				<p>A: Yes! Our founders, Ruth Galdamez and Andrea Portilla, both work diligently in their churches in women’s ministry. They are a mother/daughter team!</p>
				<p>Q: What is LovelyBox and how does it work?</p>
				<p>A: Lovely Box was inspired as both women began to see a need in the lives of their friends and coworkers. Christian women that have a full plate and at times feel alone, depressed and lost in a sea of fear. How great would it be to encourage one woman at a time with a LovelyBoxfilled with love?</p>

				<p>A: Not at this time.</p>

				<p>A: Each month’s box is unique, filled with beauty sampesl, prayer cards, scripture cards, jewelry and various trinkets that you will love to receive.</p>

				<p>A: Yes, subscriptions will auto-renew for the same subscription period for which you signed up. However, it’s easy to cancel if you choose to cancel. Gifts do not auto-renew. </p>
